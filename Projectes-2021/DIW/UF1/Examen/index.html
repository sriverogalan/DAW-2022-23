            <h1>Adopta un ca</h1>
            <p>A building’s foundation defines its footprint, which defines its frame, which shapes the facade. Each
                phase of the architectural process is more immutable, more unchanging than the last. Creative
                decisions quite literally shape a physical space, defining the way in which people move through its
                confines for decades or even centuries.</p>
            <p>Working on the web, however, is a wholly different matter. Our work is defined by its transience,
                often refined or replaced within a year or two. Inconsistent window widths, screen resolutions, user
                preferences, and our users’ installed fonts are but a few of the intangibles we negotiate when we
                publish our work, and over the years, we’ve become incredibly adept at doing so.</p>
            <p>But the landscape is shifting, perhaps more quickly than we might like. Mobile browsing is expected
                to outpace desktop-based access within three to five years. Two of the three dominant video game
                consoles have web browsers (and one of them is quite excellent). We’re designing for mice and
                keyboards, for T9 keypads, for handheld game controllers, for touch interfaces. In short, we’re
                faced with a greater number of devices, input modes, and browsers than ever before.</p>
            <p>In recent years, I’ve been meeting with more companies that request “an iPhone website” as part of
                their project. It’s an interesting phrase: At face value, of course, it speaks to mobile WebKit’s
                quality as a browser, as well as a powerful business case for thinking beyond the desktop. But as
                designers, I think we often take comfort in such explicit requirements, as they allow us to
                compartmentalize the problems before us. We can quarantine the mobile experience on separate
                subdomains, spaces distinct and separate from “the non-iPhone website.” But what’s next? An iPad
                website? An N90 website? Can we really continue to commit to supporting each new user agent with its
                own bespoke experience? At some point, this starts to feel like a zero sum game. But how can we—and
                our designs—adapt?</p>
